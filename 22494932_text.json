Theestimated number of new lung cancer cases in the UnitedStates was 219,440 cases in the year of 2009 and around159,390 cases died from this disease [2]. Lung carcinoma isresponsible for 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually [3].Traditionally, the prognosis of lung cancer patients is gener-ally poor and the median survival for patients presenting withadvanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated withchemotherapy alone is about 10 months [4]. Thus, there is aneedforbetterscreeningandtreatmentmodalitiesforthisdis-ease. The dismal prognosis and the limited tumor response toconventional cytotoxic agents posed a challenge to the scien-tiﬁccommunitytocomeupwithalternativetargetedtherapiesheralding better clinical responses all with minimizing theadverse effects. Angiogenesis targeting agents were amongthe ﬁrst to be recognized for potential beneﬁt in NSCLC [5].However when applied in different settings, monoclonal anti-bodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and other classes ofagents did not yield a consistent response among patientswith NSCLC [6]. Hence emerges the role of biomarkers intailoring therapeutic strategies to patient’s biological makeupand optimizing clinical response. This paper revisits the roleof anti-angiogenic agents in NSCLC and focuses mainly onthe prognostic and predictive value of two major angiogenicmarkers vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basicﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF)."

For more than a decade, the role ofvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the regulationof angiogenesis has been under investigation [8]. This pro-cess is important for the growth of new blood vessels duringfetal development and tissue repair; however, uncontrolledangiogenesis promotes neoplastic diseases and other disor-ders. The successful implementation of this process dependsupon the balance of growth promoting factors and growthinhibitory factors [9,10]. Tumor growth and metastasis aredependent on angiogenesis [11]. Angiogenesis depends onthe balance between different molecules released by the hostand tumor cells, and consists of a series of steps, includingseparation of endothelial cells from pericytes and the base-ment membrane, invasion and migration across basementmembranes, and eventually resulting in extension into thetumor body [12,13]. Speciﬁc angiogenic molecules can ini-tiate this process whereas speciﬁc inhibitory molecules canstop it [14].There is evidence that angiogenesis is a relativelyearly event during lung cancer pathogenesis.

Monoclonal antibodies and receptorTKIs were designed and tested in clinical trials in attempt toimprove the therapeutic effect of the conventional cytotoxicagents [19,20]. In the pivotal ECOG4599 trial, Bevacizumaba humanized monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF, demon-strated a signiﬁcant survival beneﬁt when added to paclitaxeland carboplatin compared to that combination alone [21].In the AVAiL trial, a smaller clinical beneﬁt was derivedfrom adding bevacizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin com-bination [22]. A closer look at the patient population showsthat patients with squamous cell carcinoma were excludedbased on safety data from a previous phase II trial [23]. Beva-cizumab use was associated with major hemoptysis and fatalpulmonary hemorrhage in patients with squamous cell lungcancer. In the latter group, tumors have a predilection to becavitating and centrally located. The friable nature rendersthem prone to erode into vicinous major pulmonary vesselsand subsequently causing extensive pulmonary hemorrhage.Further exploration of patients’ susceptibility to beva-cizumab requires the search for molecular markers associatedwith survival and response. On evaluation of sera of patientsenrolled in ECOG4599 trial, higher plasma circulating levelsofVEGFpredictedbetterresponsetobevacizumabtreatment,but this was not predictive of overall survival [24]. In theAVAiL trial a high baseline level of beta ﬁbroblast growthfactor (Beta FGF) and VEGF and other factors was associatedwith shorter overall survival [25,26].In addition to bevacizumab, other agents have been impli-cated in phase II trials in NSCLC (Table 1).One of the agents, Vandetanib, a VEGFR, EGFR and RETtyrosine kinase inhibitor showed improvement in progres-sion free survival in three phase II trials in patients withadvanced NSCLC [27–29]. Low baseline circulating VEGFpredicted a therapeutic beneﬁt in PFS in the above studieswhen using vandetanib [30].

On the other hand,increases in VEGF and decreases in soluble VEGF recep-tor 2 (sVEGFR-2) have been found to be a class effect ofvandetanib as reported in phase I and II studies of VEGFRTKIs [31,32]. The incongruity in the above ﬁndings can beattributed to the complexity of angiogenic pathways, lack ofstandardized detection techniques and poorly deﬁned cutoffvalues [32]. In a study conducted on patients treated withpazopanib an antiangiogenic agent, plasma sVEGFR2 wasassociated with tumor shrinkage [33].

The VEGF gene which islocated on the short arm of chromosome 6 is composed ofeight exons and is differentially spliced to yield four isoforms(VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189 and VEGF206) [37]. Inaddition, some less commonly expressed isoforms were iden-tiﬁed (VEGF145 and VEGF183) [38].The VEGF family comprises seven secreted glycopro-teins that are designated VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C,VEGF-D, VEGF-E, placental growth factor (PlGF) andVEGF-F [39–41].

Upon binding of VEGF-A to theextracellular domain of the receptor, a cascade of downstreamproteins is activated after the dimerization and autophospho-rylation of the intracellular receptor tyrosine kinases (Fig. 1).VEGF induces proliferation, sprouting and tube formationof endothelial cells [39]. VEGFR-2 appears to be the mainreceptor responsible for mediating the proangiogenic effectsof VEGF-A [42,43].VEGF-B binds to VEGFR-1 but not VEGFR-2 orVEGFR-3, and the activation of this receptor induces a poormitogenic signal for endothelial cells suggesting that VEGF-B is an inefﬁcient endothelial cell mitogen [44]. VEGF-Bmight have a role in inﬂammatory [45] and cardiac angio-genesis [46].VEGF-C is a ligand for VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 [47].During development, VEGF-C is expressed along withits receptor VEGFR-3 mainly in regions where lymphaticvessels develop [48]. VEGF-C is also chemotactic formacrophages, and its receptor VEGFR-3 is expressed by afraction of peripheral blood monocytes and activated tissuemacrophages [49]. VEGF-C induces selective lymphangio-genesis without accompanying angiogenesis [50], and it hasbeen shown to have a positive role in lymphatic invasion,lymphatic metastasis and patient survival [51]."

In humans, VEGFs and their receptors are expressed inmany solid tumors including breast [53], colon [54], ovary[55], cervix [56], and lung carcinoma [57,58]. The ﬁrst reporton VEGF expression in NSCLC was by Mattern et al. [57].This group of investigators demonstrated a negative prognos-tic role of VEGF expression in lung cancer tumors [59,60].Since then, numerous studies in early stage NSCLC havereported the overexpression of VEGF and its associationwith progression or poor survival [58,19,61–71]. In addi-tion, other studies demonstrated an association with survival(either overall or progression-free) and a correlation betweenVEGF expression and microvessel density [72–76]. In con-trast, some studies did not show any association betweenVEGF expression and survival [77,78]. Table 2 summarizesthe main studies that showed a poor prognostic impact ofVEGF expression in NSCLC. It is worth mentioning thatmost of the studies found a poor prognostic signiﬁcance ofVEGF expression in tumor cells; however, VEGF was notan independent prognostic parameter in multivariate analysis[59,60,64,71].One meta-analysis studying the prognostic impact ofVEGF expression in NSCLC was published by Delmotteet al. [79]. The authors performed a systematic review ofthe English and French literature with regard to both NSCLCand small cell lung cancer, and the inclusion criteria for arti-cles demanded existing data on the expression of VEGF orits receptors as well as the association between expressionand survival. Fifteen studies (1549 patients) were devotedto NSCLC. The meta-analysis showed that VEGF is anunfavorable prognostic factor in NSCLC (HR = 1.48; 95%conﬁdence interval (CI) 1.27–1.72). Another recent meta-analysis included in the analysis 4499 patients with NSCLCfrom 38 studies that were categorized by patient ethnicity,histology, disease stage, VEGF isoform, and laboratory tech-niques used [80]. Combined hazard ratios suggested thatVEGF over-expression regardless of its isoform indicated apoor prognosis for patients with NSCLC (HR = 1.46; 95% CI1.38–1.54). However, VEGF-C overexpression did not sig-niﬁcantly correlate with survival in these patients (HR = 1.22;95% CI 0.96–1.47) [80].In a relatively recent study, Nakashima et al. found thatintratumoral expression of different classes of VEGF hadunlike prognostic relevance in the different subgroups ofNSCLC [68]. VEGF-C was a signiﬁcant poor prognosticfactor in patients with squamous cell carcinomas (relativerisk = 3.946, p = 0.0143), while VEGF-A was a signiﬁcantprognosticator for those with adenocarcinomas (relativerisk = 3.816, p = 0.0025) [68]. Another study did not showany correlation between VEGF-A expression and progno-sis in NSCLC [81]. On the other hand, the investigatorsfound that VEGF-B and VEGF-D expression had a signif-icant correlation with worse survival in patients with stage Iand II NSCLC. The expression of VEGF-D was correlatedsigniﬁcantly with better survival in patients with stage IIIand IV disease [81]. Very recently a study correlated the"

They found thatthe VEGF levels in the sera from cancer patients were sig-niﬁcantly higher than those from individuals with no signof cancer [85]. Measuring the levels of circulating angio-genic factors can theoretically reﬂect the overall angiogenicactivity of the tumor; in addition, it is more easily assessablethan evaluating tumor expression of angiogenic factors whichdepends on the availability of adequate surgical or biopsyspecimens. Compared to the immunohistochemical evalua-tion of angiogenic factors in tumor tissues, the assessmentof these angiogenic factors in blood has theoretically severaladvantages: highly available, less expensive and less time-consuming, readily performed preoperatively, easily repeatedserially, and less biased [86].Published studies on circulating VEGF and its impact onsurvival in NSCLC are less frequent than those assessingtumor VEGF expression. Some studies revealed a signif-icantly inverse association between circulating levels andsurvival [87–93]. Other studies did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcantcorrelation between circulating VEGF and survival [94–97].Pre- and post-treatment serial assessments of circulatingVEGF have been performed and the clinical signiﬁcance oftheir changes was reported.

There are at least four isoforms of bFGF with differentmolecular masses (22, 22.5, 24 and 34 kDa) [105,106]. ThebFGF gene is located on chromosome 4 [107].bFGF may exert its effect on endothelial cells via aparacrine mode as a consequence to its release by tumorand stromal cells. It is also suggested that bFGF plays anautocrine role in endothelial cells [100,108]. A large body ofresearch has implicated b-FGF as having a role in tumori-genesis. Early studies showed that elevated levels of b-FGFin urine samples were signiﬁcantly correlated with the statusand the extent of disease whether solid tumors or hemato-logical malignancies [109]. bFGF also works synergisticallywith VEGF in inducing angiogenesis [104]."

In general, the clinical signiﬁcance is more con-troversial for circulating bFGF than circulating VEGF inmalignancies.The ﬁrst study investigating serum levels of bFGF inNSCLC was reported by Brattström et al. [116]. Since thenother studies have investigated the clinical signiﬁcance of cir-culating bFGF in NSCLC. Among 68 NSCLC patients withstage I–IV disease, Brattström et al. found that elevated bFGFat diagnosis was a statistically signiﬁcant favorable prognos-ticfactorforsurvival(p = 0.048)[116].However,theseresultsdisagreed with the results from other studies. In a study byUeno et al. in 60 NSCLC patients (31 adenocarcinomas and29 squamous cell carcinomas), serum bFGF levels did notdiffer between the clinical stages of NSCLC and showed nocorrelation with survival [117]. It is worth mentioning herethat these are small studies with a limited number of patients.Other studies found that elevated bFGF levels correlatedwith poor survival in NSCLC [87,88,118]. Joensuu et al.evaluated the inﬂuence of serum bFGF on outcome in 138NSCLC [118]. The median survival time of the patients witha high bFGF level was 5 months versus 11 months in thosewith a lower level (p = 0.023). Serum bFGF levels at diag-nosis were associated with poor outcome. In the study byBrattström et al., 58 operable NSCLC patients were analyzedfor the prognostic value of serum bFGF [87]. Univariate anal-ysis found tumor burden, platelet counts, serum VEGF, andserum bFGF to be prognostic indicators for survival, whileonly serum bFGF remained signiﬁcant in the multivariateanalysis (p = 0.014) [87]."

Presently, there is a body of data supportingthe clinical prognostic impact of angiogenic factor expressionespecially VEGF expression in NSCLC tumors. In most ofthe studies done, VEGF over-expression was associated witha poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. This informationcould be of help in the designing of clinical trials mainlythose including angiogenesis inhibitors.The data on the prognostic implications of VEGF andbFGF in blood of these patients are more heterogeneous[119]. However, the evidence is still compelling and thesecirculating factors may in the future be used for evaluatingtreatment and monitoring response. Thus, further large-scalestudies are still needed to deﬁne the role of these and othermarkers in NSCLC and to validate their performance. Suchstudies need to include different targeted agents or studymulti-targeted drugs having anti-VEGF(R) or anti-FGR(R)activity. In the era of personalized medicine, there is grow-ing interest in individualizing treatment approaches in lungcancer. Moreover the concept of reverse migration entailsshifting frontline in the ﬁght against cancer from therapyto prevention. In other words, identiﬁcation of molecularbiomarkers will have implications not only on guiding ther-apy but also for intercepting cancer in high risk patients[34,120]. With all of the above taken into account, a fur-ther preventive dimension will be added to the prognosticand predictive value of molecular biomarkers, hence raisingthe plea for a better deﬁnition of their use in NSCLC."

Thus, there is strong interest indeveloping new molecular tools to predict survival and to identifypatients who may beneﬁt from targeted therapies. However, forthese molecular assays to be useful, they need to be well integratedinto the current work ﬂow of the clinic; the team would need toobtain relevant molecular data on each patient’s tumor in a timelymanner without undue treatment delay, and design appropriatetreatment regimen based on results of these genomic tests (1).

Following 10 weeks of treatment,28% of previously treated K-ras mutation-positive patients and38% of previously untreated patients who were former smokershad stable disease (12).Two distinct molecular pathways are involved in lung cancer:K-ras mutations in smokers and EGFR mutations in never-smokers. K-ras encodes a GTPase downstream of EGFR, whichmay provide a biological explanation for why EGFR and K-rasmutations appear mutually exclusive. The presence of somaticK-ras mutations appears to be associated with a lack of sensitivityto geﬁtinib and erlotinib (8). Therefore, K-ras mutational status(or lack thereof) may be an important predictive factor in deﬁningpatients who will beneﬁt most from ﬁrst-generation TKIs."

Resistance to ABT-737 is deter-mined by expression of Mcl-1, and detection of Mcl-1 may there-fore help guide clinical application of ABT-737 (48). Qian et alshowed that in Bcl-xL-overexpressing lung adenocarcinoma cells(which are resistant to apoptosis induction by the PI3K inhibitorLY294002), simultaneous inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway withLY294002 and Bcl-xL function with ABT-737-enhanced apoptoticresponse (49). These data suggest that these two pathways controlcell death in a synergistic manner, and that inhibition of Bcl-xLcould improve efﬁcacy of PI3K/Akt inhibitors.Exploitation of pro-apoptotic pathways to promote RT effec-tiveness has shown promising results. The pan-Bcl-2 inhibitorAT-101 increases apoptosis in a concentration-dependent mannerin NSCLC cells.

Two examples targets of immunemodulation include CTL-antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed-cell-death-1 (PD-1). CTLA-4 is upregulated in response to CTLactivation and is responsible for blunting further CTL activation,leading to immune tolerance to TAAs (61). PD-1, a T-cell inhib-itory receptor, also suppresses antitumor activity, and researchsuggests that CTLA-4 and PD-1 may work synergistically toinduce CTL tolerance (62).

Overexpression of speciﬁc molecular targets canalso predict RT response, as increased EGFR expression andsurvivin levels have been associated with radioresistance (9, 52).Other characteristics, such as tumor histology and patientsmoking history, also play a role in optimizing therapy. For instance,EGFR ampliﬁcation and increased gene copy number are morefrequentlyassociatedwithsquamousthanadenocarcinomahistology (68), whereas cancers expressing ELM4-ALK are morecommonly classiﬁed as adenocarcinoma (32). Mutations in K-rasand the tyrosine kinase BRAF are more common in former smokers,whereas EGFR mutations and ELM4-ALK are more common inpatients with limited smoking history (8, 69, 32), suggesting theability to predict molecular targets from clinical history.Yet, basing NSCLC treatment solely on histologic and clinicalfeatures may be problematic because of their unreliability.Furthermore, using these features to determine which moleculartest to perform may be suboptimal, as highlighted by Bunn et al(70). Former smoking status is not a perfect indicator of K-ras orBRAF mutations, as EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangementshave also been found in former smokers. Similarly, histologicsubtype may not always be clear, as some tumors show mixedhistology or are too poorly differentiated. Bunn et al, therefore,pointed to initial testing of multiple molecular markers as a moretime-efﬁcient method rather than choosing single selected testsbased on clinical and histological features (70). With the rapidproduction of data currently within this area, questions related tooptimizing strategies for molecular testing of tumor tissues areclose at hand. It appears likely that K-ras mutation status will beshown to be of greatest value in predicting patients most likely tohave tumors resistant to anti-EGFR therapies. Summaries ofpreclinical studies and clinical trials of molecular targets and RTin NSCLC are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively."

For instance, Lee et al successfully sequenceda primary lung tumor and validated 530 somatic single nucleotidevariants from >50,000 identiﬁed high-conﬁdence single nucleo-tide variants (94). The study also found that mutations inexpressed genes were selected against more than mutations innonexpressed genes and promoter regions, providing evidence ofselective pressures.

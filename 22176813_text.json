Whileplatinum-based doublet therapy is the traditional treatment ofchoice for advanced/metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC), no speciﬁc regimen is clearly superior, and efﬁ-cacy with these regimens has reached a plateau in terms of overallresponse rate (RR; ∼25%–35%) and median overall survival (OS;8–10 months) [2].  Molecular testing for epidermal growth factorreceptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog(KRAS) mutations has allowed for the identiﬁcation of subsets ofpatients who will be more responsive to certain therapies. Conse-quently, the treatment of patients with NSCLC is evolving towarda more personalized approach that utilizes speciﬁc molecular andgenetic tumor proﬁles in treatment decisions. In addition to oncol-ogists, radiologists, and pathologists, pulmonologists are essential"

However, multivariate analysis revealedthat EGFR expression or EGFR copy number was not signiﬁcantlyassociated with survival beneﬁt in either treatment group.The issue of whether EGFR mutations or increased EGFR copynumber (detected via ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization [FISH])is the better biomarker for EGFR-TKI response was clariﬁed byexploratory analysis of the IPASS trial [25]. Patients with high EGFRcopy number had improved PFS with geﬁtinib vs chemotherapy(HR = 0.66, 95% conﬁdence interval, 0.50–0.88; P = 0.005). However,post hoc exploratory analyses showed this effect was primar-ily driven by overlap of high EGFR copy number with positiveEGFR-mutation status (among the 249 patients who were FISH pos-itive, 190 (78%) also harbored an EGFR mutation). Patients whowere FISH positive/mutation negative derived little or no beneﬁtfrom geﬁtinib; however, patients with EGFR mutations overall hadsigniﬁcantly longer PFS with geﬁtinib (P < 0.001) [16], suggestingthat EGFR-mutation status is the primary determinant of responseto geﬁtinib and consequently the preferred biomarker to predictEGFR-TKI beneﬁt."

Several factors must be considered whendetermining appropriate diagnostic tests, including sensitivity andspeciﬁcity, false-negative and false-positive rates, procedure mor-bidity, and tumor location and characteristics [37]. It is important tooptimize tissue recovery while decreasing procedure-related mor-bidity [38].Sputum cytology is a noninvasive procedure particularly valu-able in patients with centrally located tumors [38]; however,tumor location and size affect sensitivity of this method, and rigor-ous specimen sampling is required to ensure diagnostic accuracy.Flexible bronchoscopy is minimally invasive and most effectivewith central lesions, but may also be used in conjunction withguided imaging to evaluate peripheral lesions [38]. Bronchoscopymay be performed with or without needle aspiration, which typ-ically obtains cytologic specimens. When larger-gauge needlesare used, core samples and material for cell block may also beobtained. Another minimally invasive sampling method, transtho-racic needle aspiration, may be used for peripheral, parenchymallesions; however, there is a high false-negative rate and a riskof pneumothorax associated with this procedure [38–41].  Someof these techniques may be supplemented with medical imag-ing, such as endobronchial ultrasound, to guide sampling, avoidsurgery, and improve yield and accuracy [37,38].

Patients withEML4/ALK-expressing NSCLC are generally resistant to EGFR-TKItherapy and have tumors with wild-type EGFR and KRAS [52,54].Several novel selective ALK inhibitors are in various stages ofdevelopment [53]. Most recently, crizotinib (Xalkori®), an oral ATP-competitive selective inhibitor of the ALK and cMet (also knownas hepatocyte growth factor receptor) tyrosine kinases [55], wasapproved for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive (by anapproved molecular test) locally advanced or metastatic NSCLCbased on results from an expansion cohort of a phase I study [56,57]"

If KRAS is found to bepositive, patients can then be considered for enrollment in clinicaltrials. Fig. 3 shows a proposed molecular testing algorithm.The Biomarker-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy forLung Cancer Elimination (BATTLE) program is the ﬁrst prospectivebiopsy-mandated study to assess candidate predictive biomark-ers as a means of guiding treatment choice in heavily pretreatedpatients with advanced NSCLC [59]. Fresh core needle biopsy wasperformed upfront to test for 11 biomarkers, including EGFR andKRAS mutation by PCR, and results from these analyses were usedto select treatment based on individual patient proﬁle. Patientswith EGFR mutation had an improved 8-week disease control ratewhen treated with erlotinib (5/7; 71%), while patients with KRASmutation did not respond well to erlotinib (2/9; 22%). The BAT-TLE program represents the ﬁrst trial to evaluate the efﬁcacy ofpersonalized therapy for NSCLC and ﬁnal results are awaited.As personalized medicine for NSCLC evolves, pulmonologistsand oncologists need to effectively integrate cytologic, molecular,and histologic tests to determine the most appropriate therapyfor each individual patient. In addition to the assays discussed,there is ongoing interest in developing and implementing new, lessinvasive techniques to determine prognosis and identify appropri-ate therapy for patients with NSCLC. Potential future approachesinclude utilizing advances in imaging technology as well as serumtesting for cell-free tumor nucleic acids.In conclusion, results from several randomized phase III trialsemphasize the importance of molecular testing prior to initiat-ing ﬁrst-line therapy for advanced NSCLC. Increasing evidencedemonstrates that patients with EGFR mutations experience signif-icant beneﬁt with geﬁtinib or erlotinib vs standard chemotherapy,with an opposite effect occurring in patients with EGFR-mutationnegative tumors. As molecular testing becomes standard clinicalpractice, pulmonologists will play a vital role in ensuring samplesof adequate quality and quantity are available for these purposes."
